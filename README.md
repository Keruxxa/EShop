This is my pet-project in which I'm actually learning `ASP.NET Core` and some others technologies like `Docker`, `Kafka` and `Redis`. Code base increases and changes as I explore and study programming using `C#`

This project is an online store where people will be able to sign up, serf the store to look up for stuff they need and want to order.

The upcoming features I'm going to add and implement:
- authorization
- unit testing
- redis cache
- kafka

I'm currently working on `Development` branch.
